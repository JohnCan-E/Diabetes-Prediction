# Diabetes-Prediction


-After transferring the necessary libraries to our ipykernel, visualized with matplotlib. 
-x and y axises determined 
-dropped(removed) dependent variable ; which was axis =1 (Glucose)
-raw data values have to be within 0 and 1, so normailization's done
-I split train and test data from each other
-I trained data to distinguish between healthy and diabetic people
-KNN Model 've been created
-I tested the data for k range and set values according to  a 'for loop' which I have created.
-As last scaled the data with Min-Max, and made predictions with the KNN model. As a result, the risk of diabetes was estimated.
